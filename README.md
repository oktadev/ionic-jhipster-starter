The Ionic JHipster Starter is designed to be used with a JHipster backend. You can create a project with it directly, or use [Ionic for JHipster](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/generator-jhipster-ionic).

This project provides a base template of functionality for an Ionic app. The Ionic for JHipster module provides entity generation and additional features that require logic to install (e.g. OAuth authentication).

## Getting Started

To use this starter, install the latest version of the Ionic CLI and run:

```bash
ionic start ionic4j oktadeveloper/jhipster
```

You can also install it using the [Ionic for JHipster Module](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/generator-jhipster-ionic):

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-ionic ionic @angular/cli
yo jhipster-ionic
```

This module allows you to generate entities using:

```bash	
yo jhipster-ionic:entity <name>	
```

Or by importing JDL:

```bash
yo jhipster-ionic:import-jdl <file.jdl>
```

### Tips

In production, you will need to enable CORS in your backend's `src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml` file. Set the allowed-origins so it works with `ionic serve`:
         
```yaml
cors:
    allowed-origins: "http://localhost:8100"
```

## Pages

The Ionic JHipster Starter comes with a variety of ready-made pages. 

## Services

The Ionic JHipster Starter comes with some basic implementations of common services.

### User

The `User` service is used to authenticate users through its
`login(accountInfo)` and `signup(accountInfo)` methods, which perform `POST`
requests to an API endpoint that you will need to configure.

### Api

The `ApiService` is a simple CRUD frontend to an API.

## i18n

The Ionic JHipster Starter comes with internationalization (i18n) out of the box with
[ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core). This makes it easy to
change the text used in the app by modifying only one file. 

### Adding Languages

To add new languages, add new files to the `src/assets/i18n` directory,
following the pattern of LANGCODE.json where LANGCODE is the language/locale
code (ex: en/gb/de/es/etc.).

## Testing

This starter borrows its testing infrastructure from Daniel Sogl's [Ionic Super Starter](https://github.com/danielsogl/ionic-super-starter). Thanks Daniel!

### Usage

There are a number of scripts in `package.json` you can use to run tests:

```json
"test": "jest",
"test:watch": "jest --watch",
"test:ci": "jest --runInBand",
"test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
"e2e": "npm run e2e-update && npm run e2e-test",
"e2e-test": "protractor ./e2e/protractor.conf.js",
"e2e-update": "node node_modules/webdriver-manager/bin/webdriver-manager update --gecko false"
```

### Unit Tests

[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is used as the unit test runner in this project. Jest is a complete and easy to set-up JavaScript testing solution created by Facebook. Some of its benefits are:

- Fast and sandboxed
- Built-in code coverage reports
- Zero configuration

**NOTE:** If you'd like to convert your project so you can run `ng test` to run your tests, see [Angular CLI: "ng test" with Jest in 3 minutes](https://codeburst.io/angular-6-ng-test-with-jest-in-3-minutes-b1fe5ed3417c).

To run a unit test you have three options.

1. Run `npm test` runs all your created unit-tests
2. Run `npm run test:ci` if you want to run the unit-tests with you favorite CI
3. To create a test-coverage report you can run `npm run test:coverage`

Daniel created Ionic Mocks with Jest Support by forking the [ionic-mocks](https://github.com/stonelasley/ionic-mocks) ionic-mock repository. There are still some issues. Feel free to help him out with his [ionic-mocks-jest](https://github.com/danielsogl/ionic-mocks-jest) repository.

If you want to add ionic-native mocks you should definitely check out Chris Griffith's [ionic-native-mocks](https://github.com/chrisgriffith/ionic-native-mocks) repository

See the unit test example at [`src/app/app.component.spec.ts`](src/app/app.component.spec.ts).

### E2E Tests

The E2E test configuration is from the official [ionic-unit-testing-example](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-unit-testing-example) repository. The e2e folder structure has been changed a bit.

```
/e2e
  - pages
  - spec
```

Add your pages into the `/pages` folder and your tests into the `/spec` folder.

See the example end-to-end test in [`e2e/spec/app.e2e-spec.ts`](e2e/spec/app.e2e-spec.ts).

To run the e2e tests, start your app, then run the tests (in two separate terminal windows):

```bash
ionic serve
npm run e2e
```
